## Description
This project presents a user-friendly dashboard for querying an e-commerce database. Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, it serves as an interface to interact with a custom **SQLite** database, facilitating searches and displaying results effectively. The dashboard utilizes EJS templates (index.ejs and results.ejs) to render data dynamically based on user inputs.

## Technologies Used
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* **SQLite**: A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
* **EJS**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
